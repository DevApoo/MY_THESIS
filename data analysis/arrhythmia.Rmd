This file is used to watch file sav.

## Loading libs and data
We first load some necessary libs
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
library(readxl)
source('multiplot.R')

load file data
```{r}
oxy = read.csv('E:\MY_THESIS\RECORDINGS\08_12_stchange.sav')
oxy = as.data.table(oxy)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
