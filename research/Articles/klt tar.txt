The sXYYYZ.tsr.zip files, where X is the number of ECG leads,
YYY is the patient number, and Z is the record number of this
patient, contain following files:

sXYYYZ_fin.dmy - Fine diagnostic and morphology time series
sXYYYZ_raw.dmy - Raw diagnostic and morphology time series
sXYYYZ_1.sta   - ST segment markers according to annotation
                 protocol A

These three files are needed internally by SEMIA viewing tool.

To unzip each sXYYYZ.tsr.zip file type:

unzip sXYYYZ.tsr.zip

The sXYYYZ.stf files, where X is the number of ECG leads,
YYY is the patient number, and Z is the record number of this
patient, are ASCII files and contain:
 - Raw ST level function
 - Raw inearly approximated baseline ST level function
   (raw ST reference function)
 - Raw ST deviation function
for each ECG lead. These files are intended to users.

Columns in the sXYYYZ.stf file represent:

Column  1:  Sample index
Column  2:  ST level     (lead 0) (20 units = 100 uV)
Column  3:  ST reference (lead 0) (20 units = 100 uV)
Column  4:  ST deviation (lead 0) (20 units = 100 uV)
Column  5:  ST level     (lead 1) (20 units = 100 uV)
Column  6:  ST reference (lead 1) (20 units = 100 uV)
Column  7:  ST deviation (lead 1) (20 units = 100 uV)
[ Column  8:  ST level     (lead 2) (20 units = 100 uV) ]
[ Column  9:  ST reference (lead 2) (20 units = 100 uV) ]
[ Column 10:  ST deviation (lead 2) (20 units = 100 uV) ]

The sXYYYZ.klt.zip files, where X is the number of ECG leads,
YYY is the patient number, and Z is the record number of this
patient, are compressed ASCII files and contain:
 - Time series of ST segment Karhunen-Loeve transform
   coefficients (ST segment principal components)
 - Time series of QRS complex Karhunen-Loeve transform
   coefficients (QRS complex principal components)
These files are intended to users.

To unzip each sXYYYZ.klt.zip file type:

unzip sXYYYZ.klt.zip

Columns in the sXYYYZ.klt file represent:

Column  1:  Sample index
Column  2:  ST segment  KL coefficient 1 (100 units = 1 st.d.)
Column  3:  ST segment  KL coefficient 2 (100 units = 1 st.d.)
Column  4:  ST segment  KL coefficient 3 (100 units = 1 st.d.)
Column  5:  ST segment  KL coefficient 4 (100 units = 1 st.d.)
Column  6:  ST segment  KL coefficient 5 (100 units = 1 st.d.)
Column  7:  ST segment  KL Mahalanobis distance using the
            first 5 KL coefficients      (100 units = 1 st.d.)
Column  8:  QRS complex KL coefficient 1 (100 units = 1 st.d.)
Column  9:  QRS complex KL coefficient 2 (100 units = 1 st.d.)
