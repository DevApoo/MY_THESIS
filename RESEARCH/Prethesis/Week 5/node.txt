Details:

1. Clinical
- silent ischemia, known as silent MI, là
	+ giai doan dau cua Myocardial Infarction
	+ có the preceed thành STEMI, NSTEMI
	+ mostly come with angina
- 3 types:
	+ type 1: most commonly with angina
	+ type 2: also common, in patient with prior MI
	+ type 3: least common, without angina

- Diagnostics: cardiac enzymes, stress test cause ST-depress, ST + heart rate monitor using Holter monitor (2 leads, 24-48h)
	       implantable devices, cardiac imaging

- Procedure: with or without angina -> stress test -> ST Deviation
	+ STD?  -> AECG on the lead that cause STD -> result
	+ non STD? -> suspect? -> test khac: cardiac enzyme, CT ...

- Limitation:
	+ cardiac enzyme: blood test, only at hospital ...
	+ stress test: STD not always show up
	+ Holter suffer from false posity: ST can depress during daily activities, such as postures.
					   there is differences, however, quite weak.
	+ implantable devices: invasive


2. Computational Algorithm: lastest revision is in 2013, detect abnormal ST-seg using moving window

- morphological characteristics of ST deviation: >= 1.0 mm from baseline, happen in episodes, episode lasts for > 1 min
- other variables: depth of depression, duration of the episode, area-under-the-curve of the ST-segment depression
- clinical variables: Heart rate (80% of silent ischemia), RR-interval, VPB count, SVPB count 

- Limatation:
	+ lack of data: 48h monitor, cost 40MB per records -> in sufficient of database (long-term ST, European ST-T physionet)
	+ reliance of detection algorithm
	+ false posity due to: changes in postures... can also cause ST Deviation
- Good knowledge: 
	+ increase of heart rate, increase of blood pressure before STD is the current characteristics of silent ischemia
	+ STD happen in episodes, episode > 30s each
	+ STD during Holter is better than STD in stress test for detection

=> ECG provesto be unsufficient, sensitivity 64%
=> Emerging technique: intra-cardiac temperature monitoring, Tissue O2 tension, CT, near Infrared spectroscopy
